Just a note because it took me a minute to understand:

The bitmap format used by the gameboy uses 2 bits per pixel... but they are not in sequence: For every bitmap there's every odd bit first, then every even bit.

So

000000011011100100

is saved as 

0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 
 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0

->

000011100000101010

And that's per sprite (8x8 or 8x16).
