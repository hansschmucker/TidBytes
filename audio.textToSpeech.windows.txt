Windows still contains a very simple, but incredibly lightweight TTL that's super easy to use in C#
Word of warning though, IIS/ASPX doesn't like it.

Just remember you need the voices installed. Powershell makes it easiest

Find voice with
 Get-WindowsCapability -Online | ? Name -like Language.TextToSpeech~~~* | ? State -like NotPresent | Select -Property Name

install with
 Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name "MYVOICE"

You can use it with
 var synth=new System.Speech.Synthesis.SpeechSynthesizer()

Assign a voice with:
 var voice=synth.GetInstalledVoices().OfType<InstalledVoice>().Where(a =>
  a.VoiceInfo.Culture.TwoLetterISOLanguageName.ToLower().Contains(lang)
  && a.VoiceInfo.Name.ToLower().Contains(voiceName) ).FirstOrDefault();
 synth.SelectVoice(voice.VoiceInfo.Name);

Now all you got to do is play
 synth.Speak("Whatever");

If you want to record it to a wav just set a destination
 synth.SetOutputToWaveFile("out.wav");
